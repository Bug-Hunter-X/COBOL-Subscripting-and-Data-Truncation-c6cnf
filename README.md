This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programming related to subscripting and data truncation. The provided COBOL code snippet initializes two areas, then attempts to fill them with characters in a loop using subscripting. However, incorrect handling of the loop leads to a data truncation error. The solution demonstrates the correct method to perform this action, thereby avoiding unintended issues.
